Yes, but I also didn't want to add any new cases in case people add
new min/max() users.

But:

Oh, ok, in that case, just drop the __builtin_types_compatible_p()
entirely. It's not adding anything.

I was expecting the non-chosen expression in __builtin_choose_expr()
to not cause type warnings. I'm actually surprised it does. Type games
is why __builtin_choose_expr() tends to exist in the first place.

I don't want to weaken the type enforcement, and I _thought_ you had
done that __builtin_types_compatible_p() to keep it in place.

But if that's not why you did it, then why was it there at all? If the
type warning shows through even if it's in the other expression, then
just a


#define __min(t1, t2, x, y)                             \
        __builtin_choose_expr(                          \
                __builtin_constant_p(x) &               \
                __builtin_constant_p(y),                \
                (t1)(x) < (t2)(y) ? (t1)(x) : (t2)(y),  \
                __single_eval_min(t1, t2,               \
   ...

would seem to be sufficient?

Because logically, the only thing that matters is that x and y don't
have any side effects and can be evaluated twice, and
"__builtin_constant_p()" is already a much stronger version of that.

Hmm? The __builtin_types_compatible_p() just doesn't seem to matter
for the only thing I thought it was there for.
