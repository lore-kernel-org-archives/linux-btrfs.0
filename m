In 2.6.39 it won't even use address spaces for metadata caching.

Besides, XFS already has pretty sophisticated metadata readahead
built in - it's one of the reasons why the XFS directory code scales
so well on cold cache lookups of arge directories - so I don't see
much need for such an interface for XFS.

Perhaps btrfs would be better served by implementing speculative
metadata readahead in the places where it makes sense (e.g. readdir)
bcause it will improve cold-cache performance on a much wider range
of workloads than at just boot-time....

Cheers,

Dave.
