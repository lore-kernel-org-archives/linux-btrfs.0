uptodate bit isn't really needed, but I added it to make sure the page
is valid.

My point is fincore() isn't designed only for readahead. People will use
it like mincore, which is its normal usage. Checking the bits will break
its normal usage, because fincore just doesn't check if the fd means a
metadata inode.

get it. don't know if there is valid usage though.
