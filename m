I suppose the idea was that you could ask the kernel to dedupe a bunch of files
"atomically" and that locks would be held (at least on the source file) during
the entire operation...?

Ick.  Given that you can have 65536 vectors of 16MB apiece, you could be
reading up to 1TB of data into the pagecache.  That's a lot for a single
ioctl, though I guess we unlock all the inodes between each vector.

(Welll... we don't check for pending signals.  Urk.)

That's a very good point!  We needn't limit the API to whatever the first
implementer does; all of the above are valid interpretations of what dedupe
could involve.  I might even argue that this is the use-case for the vectorized
dedupe call -- analyze all these proposed deduplications and figure out the
best plan to make it happen.

(Ofc the current implementation doesn't allow this, but we can change the
code when the singularity happens, etc.)

I don't like the idea of being able to make major changes to a file that
I've opened with O_RDONLY. :)

I suppose if you're going to allow the FS to figure out its own strategy
and all that, then by the above reasoning one ought to have all the files
opened as writable.

I don't know if there was a previous discussion, alas.

There's a lot of unfortunate hand-waving in that manpage -- I wasn't involved
in designing the initial ioctl, so for the most part I'm simply sniffing my
way through based on observed behaviors (of duperemove) and guessing based on
the source code as I write the XFS version. :)

It's at the top of xfs_file_share_range() in the more recent RFCs of XFS reflink.

Indeed.  I appreciate your review of the manpages/patches!
