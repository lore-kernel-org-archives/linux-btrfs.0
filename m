Getting rid of the vectorization certainly avoids a lot of API complexity.  I
don't know precisely why it was made vectorized in the first place, but to me it
seems it shouldn't be vectorized unless there's a strong reason for it to be.

Deduplication is a strange operation since you're not "reading" or "writing" in
the traditional sense.  All file data stays exactly the same from a user
perspective.

So rather than arbitrarily say that you're "reading" from one file and "writing"
to the other, one possibility is to have an API where you submit two files and
the implementation decides how to best deduplicate them.  That could involve
sharing existing extents in file 1 with file 2; or sharing existing extents in
file 2 with file 1; or creating a new extent and referencing it from each file.
It would be up to the implementation to choose the most efficient approach.

But I take it that the existing btrfs ioctl doesn't work that way, and it always
will share the existing extents in file 1 with file 2.

That's probably a perfectly fine way to do it, but I was wondering whether it
really makes sense to hard-code that detail in the API, since an API could be
defined more generally.

And from a practical perpective, people using the ioctl to deduplicate two files
need to know which one to submit to the API as the "source" and which as the
"destination", if it matters.

Related to this are the permissions you need on each file descriptor.  Since
deduplication isn't "reading" or "writing" in the traditional sense it could,
theoretically, be argued that no permissions at all should be required: neither
FMODE_READ nor FMODE_WRITE.

Most likely are concerns that would make that a bad idea, though.  Perhaps
someone could create mischief by causing fragmentation in system files.

If this was previously discussed, can you point me to that discussion?

The proposed man page is also very brief on permissions, only mentioning them
indirectly in the error codes section.

If the destination file has to already be open for writing then it can't be
immutable.  So I don't think that error code is needed.  Checking for an active
swapfile, on the other hand, may be valid, although I don't see such a check
anywhere in the version of the code I'm looking at.

clone and clone_range seem to avoid the two biggest issues I saw: they aren't
vectorized, and there's a natural distinction between the "source" and the
"destination" of the operation.  They definitely need careful consideration as
well, though.
