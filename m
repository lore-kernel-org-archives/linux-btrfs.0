If that is the main obstacle, why not do straightforward fincore()/
fadvise(), and add ioctls to btrfs to export/grab the hidden
btree_inode in any form?  This will address btrfs' specific issue, and
have the benefit of making the VFS part general enough. You know
ext2/3/4 already have block_dev ready for metadata readahead.

Thanks,
