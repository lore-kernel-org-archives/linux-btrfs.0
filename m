gfs2 fallocate is an implementation that will cause all but the most
trivial users real pain.  Even the initial XFS implementation just
marking the transactions synchronous made it unusable for all kinds
of applications, and this is much worse.  E.g. a NFS ALLOCATE operation
to gfs2 will probab;ly hand your connection for extended periods of
time.

If we need to support something like what gfs2 does we should have a
separate flag for it.
