metadata page in ext2/3 doesn't have reference bit set, while btrfs has.
we can't blindly filter out such pages with the bit. fincore can takes a
parameter or it returns a bit to distinguish referenced pages, but I
don't think it's a good API. This should be transparent to userspace.

this need filesystem specific hook too, the difference is your proposal
uses fadvise but I'm using ioctl. There isn't big difference.

BTW, it's hard to hook btrfs_inode to a fd even with a ioctl, at least I
didn't find a easy way to do this. It might be possible to do this for
example adding a fake device or fake fs (anon_inode doesn't work here,
IIRC), which is a bit ugly. Before it's proved generic API can handle
metadata readahead, I don't want to do it.
