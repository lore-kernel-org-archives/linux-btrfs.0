Subject: [PATCH 0/8 v6] btrfs direct-io using iomap
Date:   Fri, 13 Dec 2019 13:57:42 -0600
Message-Id: <20191213195750.32184-1-rgoldwyn@suse.de>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.16.4

This is an effort to use iomap for direct I/O in btrfs. This would
change the call from __blockdev_direct_io() to iomap_dio_rw().

The main objective is to lose the buffer head and use bio defined by
iomap code, and hopefully to use more of generic-FS codebase.

These patches are based and tested on v5.5-rc1. I have tested it against
xfstests/btrfs.

The tree is available at
https://github.com/goldwynr/linux/tree/btrfs-iomap-dio

Changes since v1
- Incorporated back the efficiency change for inode locking
- Review comments about coding style and git comments
- Merge related patches into one
- Direct read to go through btrfs_direct_IO()
- Removal of no longer used function dio_end_io()

Changes since v2
- aligning iomap offset/length to the position/length of I/O
- Removed btrfs_dio_data
- Removed BTRFS_INODE_READDIO_NEED_LOCK
- Re-incorporating write efficiency changes caused lockdep_assert() in
  iomap to be triggered, remove that code.

Changes since v3
- Fixed freeze on generic/095. Use iomap_end() to account for
  failed/incomplete dio instead of btrfs_dio_data

Changes since v4
- moved lockdep_assert_held() to functions calling iomap_dio_rw()
  This may be called immidiately after calling inode lock and
  may feel not required, but it seems important.
- Removed comments which are no longer required
- Changed commit comments to make them more appropriate

Changes since v5
- restore inode_dio_wait() in truncate
- Removed lockdep_assert_held() near callers
