BTW., while I fully agree with everything you said, it's not entirely correct to 
claim that if a C compiler can generate VLA code it is necessarily able to parse 
and evaluate constant array sizes "just fine".

Constant expressions are typically parsed very early on, at the preprocessing 
stage. They can be used with some preprocessor directives as well, such as '#if' 
(with some further limitations on their syntax).

If VLA support is implemented in a later stage, and results in heavy-handed code 
generation that will technically work for constant value expressions as well but 
results in suboptimal code, then a warning should probably be emitted - and it 
wouldn't be pedantic.

The existing warning is still very misleading:

  warning: ISO C90 forbids variable length array ‘array’ [-Wvla]

... and if my above theory is correct then I think a better warning would be 
something like:

  warning: Array declaration is not a C90 constant expression, resulting in VLA code generation

... and note that in this specific case it's not misleading to talk about VLAs in 
the warning text, because the array size, even if it's constant value, results in 
VLA code generation.

I don't know whether GCC has such a limitation, but a quick experiment with GCC 
7.2 suggests that a (2,3) array size expression results in a lot more code being 
generated than with a constant expression.

Thanks,
