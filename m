GFS2 breaks other expectations as well (mostly stuff with locking) in 
arguably more significant ways, so I would not personally consider it to 
be precedent for breaking this on other filesystems.

posix_fallocate is not the same thing as the fallocate syscall.  It's 
there for compatibility, it has less functionality, and most 
importantly, it _can_ be slow (because at least glibc will emulate it if 
the underlying FS doesn't support fallocate, which means it's no faster 
than just using dd).
