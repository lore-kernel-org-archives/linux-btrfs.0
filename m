That really depends on how it's done.  AFAIK, unwritten extents on BTRFS 
are block reservations which make sure that you can write there (IOW, 
the unwritten extent gets converted to a regular extent in-place, not 
via COW).  This means that it is possible to guarantee that the first 
write to that area will work, which is technically all that POSIX 
requires.  This in turn means that stuff like SystemD and RDBMS software 
don't exactly see things working as they expect them too, but that's 
because they make assumptions based on existing technology.
