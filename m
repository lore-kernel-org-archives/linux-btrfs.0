current readahead syscall might already work here. however, I would
expect there is stall easily when reading dirs.
thinking 3 dirs:
/
/aa
/aa/bb
before / is in memory, reading aa will have stall. And we can't reduce
disk seeks here. metadata readahead will still have some benefits but
might not be much in such filesystem.
